This directory contains the python client lib for sofa-pbrpc.

Installation
============

1) Make sure you have Python 2.4 or newer.  If in doubt, run:

     $ python -V

2) If you do not have setuptools installed, note that it will be
   downloaded and installed automatically as soon as you run setup.py.
   If you would rather install it manually, you may do so by following
   the instructions on this page:

     http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions

3) Because this lib depends on the `protoc' tool to compile proto files,
   you should set the proper protobuf directory in `../depends.mk', for example:

     PROTOBUF_DIR=/home/users/qinzuoyan01/libs/protobuf-2.4.1/output

4) Install:

     $ python setup.py install

   This step may require superuser privileges. Or you can install to other
   directory by using `--prefix' or `--install-dir' option:
   
     $ python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
   
   Make sure that the `/path/to/install/dir' is exist.

Usage
=====

Sample code:

  from sofa.pbrpc import client
  channel = client.Channel("remotehost.example.com:1234")
  service = MyService_Stub(channel)
  controller = client.Controller()
  response = service.MyMethod(controller, request)
  if controller.Failed():
    print "[%d] %s" % (controller.ErrorCode(), controller.ErrorText())

For more details, see the sample code in `./sample'.
