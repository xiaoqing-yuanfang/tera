# Nexus Python API Manual

Python is a powerful language and is widely used. So we provide a python interface using ctypes library to communication with a C-style wrapper library.  
Since the python version is implemented by ctypes, most of the functions resemble the C++ version. For conceptions and more detailed manual, please refer to [the C++ version of manual](cxx_api.md) for now. And we will soon add more content in this manual.  
The interface is designed for Python 2.7, and we will try to make it compatible with Python 3.x.  
Happy coding!
